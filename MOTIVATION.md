## Motivation

My name is Edelcio Molina, founder of SimplificaCI and currently CPO at Progic.

Throughout my career - I have worked with complex legacy systems, large repositories, and teams adopting AI in production environments.

**I observed something consistent:**

> The challenge was not the tooling.
> It was the process.

AI tools like **GitHub Copilot** dramatically increase development speed. But in legacy and evolving systems, speed without structure quickly leads to:

* Silent architectural decisions
* Inconsistent patterns across modules
* Reduced traceability of changes
* Growing technical entropy
* Over-reliance on implicit knowledge

In complex environments — especially those that must remain stable while evolving — AI can either amplify discipline or amplify disorder.

**This project was created as a response to that reality.**

AI Legacy Orchestration is not intended to introduce heavy governance or rigid process. It introduces a minimal structure that makes architectural decisions explicit, responsibilities clear, and changes traceable.

The objective is straightforward:

- Use AI without losing engineering maturity.
- Scale productivity without sacrificing clarity.
- Preserve architectural integrity while increasing speed.

> Nothing more.
