## Motivation

My name is Edelcio Molina.

I am the founder of SimplificaCI and currently CTO at Progic, where I work closely with legacy systems, large repositories, SaaS platforms, and AI-assisted development in production environments.

Across these roles, I observed something consistent:

The challenge was not the tooling.
It was the process.

AI tools like GitHub Copilot dramatically increase development speed. But in legacy and evolving systems, speed without structure quickly leads to:

* Silent architectural decisions
* Inconsistent patterns across modules
* Reduced traceability of changes
* Growing technical entropy
* Over-reliance on implicit knowledge

In complex environments — especially those that must remain stable while evolving — AI can either amplify discipline or amplify disorder.

This project was created as a response to that reality.

AI Legacy Orchestration is not intended to introduce heavy governance or rigid process. It introduces a minimal structure that makes architectural decisions explicit, responsibilities clear, and changes traceable.

The objective is straightforward:

Use AI without losing engineering maturity.
Scale productivity without sacrificing clarity.
Preserve architectural integrity while increasing speed.

Nothing more.
